# CSCI5619 Final Project
### By Edward Shipp, Kalinda Miller, and Erik Devries Smith
In our game, you play as a wizard thief who wants to infiltrate the castle of cowboy bean. You have a spellbook showing you the different spells you have available. To cast them, you draw the pattern shown. The game is set up as a puzzle where you must cast the right spells to get through the obstacles, but some of the solutions are more open-ended, so you can experiment with different spells and beat the game in a variety of ways.
