# CSCI5619 Final Project
### By Edward Shipp, Kalinda Miller, and Erik Devries Smith
In our game, you play as a wizard thief who wants to infiltrate the cowboy beans' castle and steal their treasure. In your hand, you hold a spellbook. On one side it shows you the different spells you have available and the patterns you need to draw to cast them, and on the other side is the page you draw on to cast these spells. The game is set up as a puzzle where you must cast the right spells to get through the obstacles, but some of the solutions are more open-ended, so you can experiment with different spells and beat the game in a variety of ways. 

## Spells
- Fireball: cast on an object to light it on fire
- Ice bridge: cast twice for start and end position of bridge
- Lightning: cast on an object to use electricity on it
- Time stop: cast on an object to freeze its movement 

## Controls
- Left joystick to flip pages
- Right joystick to move
- Right trigger to draw and cast spells
- AX button to swap turning method between snap and continuous 
- BY button to swap steering method between view and hand controlled
