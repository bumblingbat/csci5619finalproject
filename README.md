# CSCI5619 Final Project
### By Edward Shipp, Kalinda Miller, and Erik Devries Smith
In our game, you play as a wizard thief who wants to infiltrate the cowboy beans' castle and steal their treasure. In your hand, you hold a spellbook. On one side it shows you the different spells you have available and the patterns you need to draw to cast them, and on the other side is the page you draw on to cast these spells. After drawing a spell, your hand turns the color of the spell to indicate you have it, and you then choose where to cast it. Upon casting, the spell fizzles out and your hand turns back to black. The game is set up as a puzzle where you must cast the right spells to get through the obstacles, but some of the solutions are more open-ended, so you can experiment with different spells and beat the game in a variety of ways.
